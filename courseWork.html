    <ul>
      <li><a href="./assignments/assignment1.html">Assignment 1: Hello, World!</a><p> My very first html assignment demonstrating the classic "Hello, World!". In this assignment, I learned the basics for HTML.</p></li>
      <li><a href="./assignments/assignment3.html">Assignment 3: Encyclopedia</a><p>The task for this assignment was to recreate a Wikipedia page. Skills learned: links, h1, href, and paragraph tags.</p></li>
      <li><a href="./assignments/assignment4.html">Assignment 4: HTML Challenges</a><p>This assignment centered around HTML-based formatting. We had to create
      a chessboard using a table, an interactive form with various input types, recreate a google search page, and consider accessibility concerns.</p></li>
      <li><a href="./assignments/assignment5.html">Assignment 5: HTML Challenges Redux</a><p>Assignment 4 revisited, with a few tweaks to include more interactive
      elements on the form and brush up any mistakes from week 4.</p></li>
      <li><a href="./assignments/assignment11.html">Assignment 11: Javascript 1</a><p>Javascript basics</p></li>
      <li><a href="./assignments/assignment12.html">Assignment 12: Javascript 2: Generate Random Person</a><p> This assignment uses a random user API to create a random user generator that displays a random name and image.</p></li>
      <li><a href="finalJava.html">Final JavaScript Project: Word Collage Generator</a><p>This is my final project for Web, where I created a tool that lets you
      input a paragraph and generate a colorful collage where the size of the words is based on the frequency of their occurence. I wrote a JavaScript program
    that takes the paragraph input, parses the string into words that are stored in an array. I then iterated through this array and converted each word
    to lower case for comparison, storing each unique word in a new array of objects containing a word and the number of times the word was found. Then,
  I created another function that iterated through this new array and incremented the font size for each occurence of a word, making the more frequently appearing
words appear larger. I also implemented a way for the color and placement of the words to be random, to make it more interesting.</p></li>
